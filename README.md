## Assignment Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to strengthen our understanding of abstraction,
its heirarchy, interfaces and their implementation, the importance of code reuse,
and unit testing. Along with this, this assignment allows us to develop our personal
programming style, as we were given much freedom when it came to choosing data
structures for containing critical data state.

## Technical Impression:
I was reminded a lot about inheritance and the importance of code reuse.
More importantly, this assignment helped me understand how abstract classes work
at a higher level of understanding than I had before. This assignment also reinforced
my decision-making skills when choosing a data structure for holding important
data states. I began this project not necessarily understanding how to approach the canPass
and chooseDirection methods, as I could not wrap my head around how to check each Direction
in "one pass." Because of this, I spent a lot of time conversing with others and reaching
out to the CS mentor suite in the Dougan building at DOU 110. I figured out, as per
usual, that I was overthinking the complexity of the methods and the state that was being passed.
I thought that terrain and directions were some complicated data types rather than
thinking of them as simply data. When I figured this out, I just proceeded to program
as I normally did; I finally completed both methods and applied the principles I gained
throughout the rest of my vehicle classes. Speaking with others allowed me to notice a few
things, such as how each vehicle that dies to another vehicle has a higher / lower death time
rate. Thus, I was able to implement all of the methods successfully.
